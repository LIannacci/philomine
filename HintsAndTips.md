# Introduction #

We will be adding to this as we encounter the inevitable issues.


# PhiloLogic Contextualizations #

Note that for lemma and bi-lemma contextualizations, you will not get all occurrences because we have implemented lemma level searching in most databases.  PhiloLogic is known to handle lemma searching if the data is available.  See the PhiloLogic release site for further details.

# Browser Considerations #

Many machine learning tasks can take a long time.  Large KNN classification tasks can go for hours.  Make sure that you browser does not have a short timeout function.  Otherwise it will timeout before you task executes.
