## PhiloMine (release 2) ##



PhiloMine is a "drop-in" extension to current  releases of [PhiloLogic](http://philologic.uchicago.edu/), to support a variety of machine learning, text mining, and document clustering tasks. It is designed to work with databases loaded under PhiloLogic, with extensions included in this release. PhiloMine release 2 is a completely rewritten and significantly enhanced revision of our first release
[PhiloMine](http://philologic.uchicago.edu/philomine/).  Like PhiloLogic, PhiloMine is a Free Software implementation designed to support research and development activities at the [ARTFL Project](http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ARTFL/) and the [Digital Library Development Center](http://dldc.lib.uchicago.edu/) with the generous support of the
[Provost's Program for Academic Technology Innovation (ATI)](http://ati.uchicago.edu/) at
the University of Chicago.

If you are interested in PhiloMine2, we recommend that you first consult our Poster Session  [Abstract](http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dd8kdbp5_8dkx57w) which is to be presented at the [Digital Humanities 2008](http://www.ekl.oulu.fi/dh2008/) conference to be held in Oulu Finland, June 25-29th and our
[PhiloMine Tour](http://docs.google.com/Present?id=ddj2s2rb_74hcggqbhm&skipauth=true) which provides an extensive overview of PhiloMine's functions and interface.

Installing PhiloMine is a non-trivial exercise.  Much of this work involves installation of our very numerous
[dependencies](http://code.google.com/p/philomine/wiki/DependencyList). We expect this code to be fairly volatile so please do take the latest version from our
[Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/philomine/downloads/list).  We have tested our
[installation](http://code.google.com/p/philomine/wiki/InstallationInstructions) instructions on two different flavors of Mac OS-X.  You will also find on our Wiki, instructions on PhiloMineLoad, HintsAndTips, a
[Bibliography](http://code.google.com/p/philomine/wiki/Bibliography) and a list of FunctionsAndParameters (pending).

_Philomine_ was a common 19th century French name (particularly Québécois), probably derived from Philomena, patron saint of "lost causes" amongst other things.
