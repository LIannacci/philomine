#summary PhiloMine2 Dependency List

!PhiloMine should run on any OS-X or Linux machine.  The more memory
and faster machine the better.  We have had success using a Mac
G5 Quad with 2GB memory and a Mac G5 Oct? with 12 GB memory.

Let us know if we missed somethinng.

Not all dependencies are required for all classifiers. If you don't want to use SVMLight or Weka functions, for example, they needn't be installed and the other PhiloMine functions will be accessible if they are installed.
