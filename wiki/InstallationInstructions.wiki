#summary Installation Guide and Packing List

= Introduction =

We have not automated the !PhiloMine installation process at this time.  The following will outline the steps for PhiloMine installation.  Note that we assume you have !PhiloLogic and the other packages listed in our DependencyList.  Again, not all of the packages in the list are required, but many are.  We will be updating the distribution on a regular basis, to fix the inevitable bugs and problems, so we advise that you not make significant modifications to the perl code at this time.


= !PhiloMine2 distribution =

Please take the most recent distribution found on [http://code.google.com/p/philomine/downloads/list Download] tab and extract the files.  The distribution should contain the following parts, which you will find in half-a-dozen folders in the philomine2/ directory:
