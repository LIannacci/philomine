#summary Installation Guide and Packing List

= Introduction =

We have not automated the !PhiloMine installation process at this time.  The following will outline the steps for !PhiloMine installation.  Note that we assume you have !PhiloLogic and the other packages listed in our DependencyList.  Again, not all of the packages in the list are required, but many are.  We will be updating the distribution on a regular basis, to fix the inevitable bugs and problems, so we advise that you not make significant modifications to the perl code at this time.


= !PhiloMine2 distribution =

Please take the most recent distribution found on [http://code.google.com/p/philomine/downloads/list Download] tab and extract the files.  The distribution should contain the following parts, which you will find in half-a-dozen folders in the philomine2/ directory:

}}}

These files must be copied into the correct locations.  Please note that we that perl is found in /usr/bin/perl  Sadly, if you have your perl someplace else, you may have to modify a number of files. 

 = Installing: Step-by-step =

We are assuming that your !PhiloLogic system installation is in the standard location, `/var/lib/philologic/`.  If this is not the case, please make the appropriate adjustments in your installation process.


  * make a directory in your `cgi-bin/` folder named `philomine2` and copy the entire contents of the distribution `cgi-bin/` directory to this location.  Check permissions and make sure to get all of the subdirectories.  
  * copy the files in `philomineload` in this distribution to a new directory `/var/lib/philologic/installdir/philomineload/`.  Again, check your permissions.
  * copy `loader.xmake` and `textload.cfg` found in `new_philologic_parts/` to `/var/lib/philologic/` You may want to back the original files up, just in case, as these replace existing files.
  * copy `xml-sgmlloader.plin` from `new_philologic_parts/` to `/var/lib/philologic/utils` (again, this replaces an existing file).
  * copy `philominesubs.pl` from the `lib` directory of this distribution to `/var/lib/philologic/installdir/lib/` 
  * copy `philomine.cfg` from `etc/` of the distribution to `/etc/philologic/` 
  * copy the files in `perl_mods/` of the distribution to where you normally have perl modules installed.  
  * copy `search3t` from `new_philologic_parts/` to your `cgi-bin/philologic/` directory.  Note that this replaces the main !PhiloLogic search routine, so you may want to back that up too.
  * copy the entire contents of `www/` in the distribution to the document root of your Web Server (or elsewhere and configure as required).  Note that this is a subdirectory here as well.


 = Configuring Your Installation =

Presuming that this all worked, edit `/etc/philologic/philomine.cfg` to suit your local installation.  If you are not using `/etc/philologic/philomine.cfg` you can edit `cgi-bin/philomine2/config.pl` as required.
